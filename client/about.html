  <h1>About This App</h1>
  <h5>This app is an interactive workout app where people can share their own unique workouts to the public. What you do is write up your personal workout, add tags relating to the workout that you are uploading (for example football and chest), and submit so other people can see. This is so you can have a variety of workouts that other people have done so that you can try new things. More features may be added soon. Contact one of us if you run into any issues or bugs.
